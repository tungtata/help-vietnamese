  <h1>Language Reference - Loop Statements</h1>
  <p>A <strong>loop</strong> is how you refer to a section of script that you repeat a number of times. You might want to loop a given number of times or you might wish to repeat a section of script as long as a certain condition is true or false.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The following loop statements are available in AutoIt:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../keywords/For.htm">For...Next</a></li>
    <li><a href="../keywords/While.htm">While...WEnd</a></li>
    <li><a href="../keywords/Do.htm">Do...Until</a></li>
    <li><a href="../keywords/ForInNext.htm">For...In...Next</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>While all the statements perform similar functions, they are slightly different and one will usually be more appropriate than another for a given situation.</p>
  <p>A loop with little or no interior code will use CPU cycles very rapidly and in the worst case could cause overheating.  A Sleep(10) line within the loop is sufficient to prevent this - note that this is not required if the code within the loop contains a blocking function (e.g. MsgBox) or GUIGetMsg.</p>
